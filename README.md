Using C# , I have made a clone of a old school tank fight game.

I previously had made this project for my studies at Queensland Univcersity of Technologly , in particular CAB201 Programming Principles. The course goal to introduce effective programming techniques and learn how methodolgies can be used to increase the down time of developing. I enjoyed the subject and it allowed my own coding methodolgy to grow and have lent what this subject gave me for the rest of my studies thus far (2018) .

The assignment itself was to complete this coding project following the brief we were given and implement several classes using abstract class , inhertence and assortment of other pieces I had picked up over the semester.

While I ended up getting full marks for this project due to completing the bouse compontents for the game , I intending to implement expeception handling and review it to show my skills and coding practices in C# for employers and to find bugs that were present in my final hand in.
